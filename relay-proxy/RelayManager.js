/*
Relay discovery and connection logic is as follows:
1. Await connection to local nostr-rs-relay
2. Connect to relays from NIP-05, or from a list of popular relays if only an npub is provided
  - retry connection attempts indefinitely, with exponential backoff to max timeout of 1 hour
3. Subscribe to events
  - Publish events to local nostr-rs-relay
  - If a Kind 3 Contact List event is received, connect to any new relays in that list that we are not already connected to and subscribe to events from those relays
  - Periodically close any relays that are not in the most recent Kind 3 Contact List Event
